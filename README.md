# Trivial

The project was made to help me get started with Livewire and create a Laravel project from scratch.
It shows facts on space, scraped from a site.

Since it's pretty basic and has trivia, it's named appropriately -  'trivial'. :p


## To start

- clone the repo - `git clone https://github.com/gautamswati/trivial`
- Install composer and npm dependencies - `composer install`, `npm install`
- Copy the env file - ` cp .env.example .env`
- Generate key - `php artisan key:generate`
- Serve using `php artisan serve`

P.S You'd require internet connectivity since the facts will be scraped from a website.

Thanks!
